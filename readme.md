# Web App Learning
## Goal of this app
Goal of this app is to practice full stack web development in advance of the NASA SpaceApps 2017 Challenge. Full stack development is really focusing on the back end and content serving, and learning how to serve up images and other analysis to the app. Front end and aesthetics are a low priority for this initial learning.
